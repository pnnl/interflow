# IWPR-WPSF

Integrated Water Power Resilience - Water & Power Sankey Flows (IWPR-WPSF) is an open source Python-based Jupyter Notebook for compiling energy and water flow data across and within the water and energy sectors at the U.S. Electricity Grid interconnection level.

## Purpose
The dependencies of the water sector on energy and the energy sector on water can lead to multi-faceted and multi-scale vulnerabilities and risks that are further exacerbated in a changing climate. Whether it is threats to water availability for electricity generation or public water supply sources facing the impacts of a power disruption event, the crossovers and interconnections between water and energy are ubiquitous and can have large impacts. While previous research has explored energy-water interconnection visualizations and data at the country-, state-, or even application-level for the U.S., this notebook calculates flows at the U.S. electricity grid interconnection scale. 

The GWEII notebook was created to:

* Reflect the flows between and within the water and energy sectors within the true decision and operational boundaries of the larger electricity sector 
* To provide informed high-level water-energy dependency insights,
* Find similarities and differences between the structure of the three U.S. electricity interconnects, and 
* Identify the relative intensities between the water and energy sectors at the interconnect-level. 

The visualization of the flows and interconnections between water and energy has been done at various scales and levels and in a variety of ways. Sankey diagrams, which provide a proportional representation of processes and major transfers within a system, are one of the most popular visualization methods for this research area. Looking from a high-level perspective, very few diagrams are available that represent the water and energy sectors equally with most diagrams choosing one sector or the other to focus on. The figure below outlines the structure of flows and dependencies across and within the water and energy sectors that are calculated within the notebook.

## Project Background

The motivation of the Integrated Water Power Resilience Project is to identify and develop opportunities to improve resilience in the water and power sectors through coordinated planning, investment, and operations and thereby provide benefits to power and water utilities, consumers, and the environment. 

Water and power utilities are interdependent, subject to many of the same natural and manmade hazards, and critical for the well-being of communities and society. Because of the interconnectedness of water and power systems there are substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits to co-managing the market sectors for resilience, instead of managing them separately.
