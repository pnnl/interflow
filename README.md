# flow

flow is an open-source python package for compiling and computing multi-unit flow data across sectors. The package was developed as part of the Integrated Water Power Resilience project at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

## Purpose
The interdependencies between sectors such as water and energy are complex. ...

The flow package was created to:

* Provide a framework to aggregate and track how energy, water, or alternative units flow through various sectors within a region
* Build additional flows in alternative units based on the flows in another
* Provide data output that can be used to generate visualizations and analysis between and within any number of sectors.

The visualization of the flows and interconnections between water and energy has been done at various scales and levels and in a variety of ways. Sankey diagrams, which provide a proportional representation of processes and major transfers within a system, are one of the most popular visualization methods for this research area but can be notoriously difficult to build data for.

## Project Background

The motivation of the Integrated Water Power Resilience Project is to identify and develop opportunities to improve resilience in the water and power sectors through coordinated planning, investment, and operations and thereby provide benefits to power and water utilities, consumers, and the environment. 

Water and power utilities are interdependent, subject to many of the same natural and manmade hazards, and critical for the well-being of communities and society. Because of the interconnectedness of water and power systems there are substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits to co-managing the market sectors for resilience, instead of managing them separately.
