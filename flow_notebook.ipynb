    "Total flows processed by wastewater treatment facilities are provided in the EPA dataset directly. However, this data will have discrepencies from the water data delivered to various sectors. To estimate water flows from residential, commercial, and industrial sectors to wastewater treatment facilities, an assumption is made that all water delivered from public water supply to these sectors is sent to wastewater treatment facilities. This assumption is also used to fill wastewater treatment flow values for regions that are unavailable in the EPA dataset. For example, south carolina does not have wastewater treatment facility values in the EPA dataset. It is assumed, therefore, that total wastewater treatment flows in south carolina and equal to the total public water supply flows for each county and is attributed to municipal discharge rather than infiltration. It is assumed that 80% of treatment flows are advanced treatment and 20% are secondary treatment. It is also assumed that all discharge is sent to surface. This follows average values for the state of North Carolina which were used as a proxy in this instance."

Total corn production for ethanol (5.22 billion bushels) was divided by total corn producton (13.6 billion bushels) for 2015 and calculated to be 38.406%. Data on a state or county-level does not exist, therefore, this percentage is applied to all states with corn production. A state-level fraction of corn used for ethanol production could be calculated from the amount of ethanol produced in a state and applying an assumption of corn required per unit of ethanol, however, not all corn used in ethanol is produced in the state that uses it which lead to states such as CA with an ethanol fraction of corn growth of nearly 900% of their total corn production. Given that we are unable to determine which states the imported corn for ethanol would be coming from, the decision was made to apply the US total fraction to all states.\n",
