    "Conveyance loss fraction for irrigation is calculated from the USGS 1995 water use dataset. It is calculated as the total conveyance losses (MGD) divided by the total water withdrawn (MGD) for irrigation. Looking at the fractions at the county level shows that a small subset of counties have unreliable values where conveyance losses are far greater than the amount withdrawn for irrigation. As a result, the ability to cap the loss fraction at a specified amount it provided and replace it with the average of the specified region. The default loss cap fraction is .90."
