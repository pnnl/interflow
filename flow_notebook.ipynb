To estimate water flows from residential, commercial, and industrial sectors to wastewater treatment facilities, an assumption is made that all water delivered from public water supply to these sectors is sent to wastewater treatment facilities. This assumption is also used to fill wastewater treatment flow values for regions that are unavailable in the EPA dataset. For example, south carolina does not have wastewater treatment facility values in the EPA dataset. It is assumed, therefore, that total wastewater treatment flows in south carolina and equal to the total public water supply flows for each county and is attributed to municipal discharge rather than infiltration. It is assumed that 80% of treatment flows are advanced treatment and 20% are secondary treatment. It is also assumed that all discharge is sent to surface.

    "Data on water used in the irrigation of corn ultimately used for ethanol production does not exist explicitly at any level of granularity and must be calculated out from larger state-level corn growth irrigation intensity estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percent of corn grown for ethanol in the US was used from US DOE Alternative Fuels Data Center [21]. Total corn production for ethanol (5.22 billion bushels) was divided by total corn producton (13.6 billion bushels) for 2015 and calculated to be 38.406%. Data on a state or county-level does not exist, therefore, this percentage is applied to all states with corn production. A state-level fraction of corn used for ethanol production could be calculated from the amount of ethanol produced in a state and applying an assumption of corn required per unit of ethanol, however, not all corn used in ethanol is produced in the state that uses it which lead to states such as CA with an ethanol fraction of corn growth of nearly 900% of their total corn production. Given that we are unable to determine which states the imported corn for ethanol would be coming from, the decision was made to apply the US total fraction to all states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total water used in the production of corn for ethanol is therefore the assumed 38.406% multiplied by the product of the total amount of irrigated acres of corn (AC_Irr_Corn) and the calculated irrigation intensity for that state (total acres applied to all crops / total acres irrigated, all crops) provided from USDA Census of Agriculture Irrigation and Water Management Survey [22], Table 35 and Table 4, respectively. The irrigation intensity for corn is calculated from the average irrigation intensity for the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To split the total MGY applied between fresh surface and groundwater, USDA FRIS Census of Agriculture data on the fraction of surface water (surface water + off farm water) from total water supply (including groundwater) in corn production is used from Table 37 of [22]. Off-farm sources are assumed to be surface water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some states that grow corn do not provide data on the water source breakdown (surface vs. ground) for their irrigation. The surface to groundwater ratio for all irrigation in a state is substituted for these states. These values are calculated from the USGS 2015 water dataset."

As a result, the ability to cap the loss fraction at a specified amount it provided and replace it with the average of the specified region. The default loss cap fraction is .90."
