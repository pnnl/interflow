* water use - "Water use associated with the farming of organisms that live in water (such as finfish and shellfish) and offstream water use associated with fish hatcheries" [1]
### livestock
* water use - "Water used for livestock watering, feedlots, dairy operations, and other on-farm needs. Types of livestock include dairy cows and heifers, beef cattle and calves, sheep and lambs, goats, hogs and pigs, horses, and poultry" [1]
### Crop irrigation
* water use - "Water that is applied by an irrigation system to assist crop and pasture growth. Irrigation includes water that is applied for pre-irrigation, frost protection, chemical application, weed control, field preparation, crop cooling, harvesting, dust suppression, leaching of salts from the root zone, and conveyance losses." [1]
### Golf Irrigation
* water use - "Water that is applied by an irrigation system to maintain vegetation on recreational lands such as parks and golf courses." [1]

## Public Water supply
* water withdrawal - "Water withdrawn by public and private water suppliers that furnish water to at least 25 people or have a minimum of 15 connections." [1]
* water exports - The difference between total withdrawals for public water supply and public water demand in a county.

## Public water Demand
* water deliveries - "Amount of water delivered from a public supplier to users for domestic, commercial, industrial, thermoelectric-power, or public-use
purposes."" [1]
* water imports - If total public water demand is greater than public water supply in a county, the difference is imported from another county.

## residential
* water use - "Water used for indoor household purposes such as drinking, food preparation, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets,
and outdoor purposes such as watering lawns and gardens" [1]

## Commercial

## mining
* water use - "Water used for the extraction of naturally occurring minerals including solids (such as coal, sand, gravel, and other ores), liquids (such as crude petroleum), and gases (such as natural gas). Also includes uses associated with quarrying, milling of mined materials, injection of water for secondary oil recovery or for unconventional oil and gas recovery (such as hydraulic fracturing), and other operations associated with mining activity. Does not include water associated with dewatering of the aquifer that is not put to beneficial use. Also does not include water used in processing, such as smelting, refining petroleum, or slurry pipeline operations." [1]

## Electricity generation
* cooling type  - "An equipment system that provides water for cooling purposes." [1]

## Energy Production

* water withdrawals
* produced water

## Wastewater treatment

## Discharges

* Water Consumption/Evaporation - "The part of water withdrawn that is evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products or crops, consumed by humans or livestock, or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment" [1]
* Conveyance Losses - "Water that is lost in transit from a pipe, canal, conduit, or ditch by leakage or evaporation" [1]
* Surface discharged
* Ground discharge
* Ocean Discharge
