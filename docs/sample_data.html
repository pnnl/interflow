<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The motivation of the Integrated Water Power Resilience Project is to identify and develop opportunities to improve resilience in the water and power sectors through coordinated planning, investment, and operations and thereby provide benefits to power and water utilities, consumers, and the environment.
Water and power utilities are interdependent, subject to many of the same natural and manmade hazards, and critical for the well-being of communities and society. Because of the interconnectedness of water and power systems there are substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits to co-managing the market sectors for resilience, instead of managing them separately.
To support this initiative and future research in this area, the <strong>interflow</strong> model was developed to build, calculate, and visualize interconnections in water and energy between various sectors.</p>

<p>The following list of assumptions are applicable to the 2015 US sample data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Calculations are for the year 2015, the most recent year available for comprehensive county-level water use data in the US. When data was unavailable for 2015, the closest year available was applied or methods were developed to develop data for 2015 based on factors from previous years.</p></li>
<li><p>Many calculation methodologies and intensity parameters are informed by the literature. References for these methodologies are noted in the methodology descriptions as applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Water values are provided in million gallons per day (MGD) and energy values are provided in billion British thermal units (BBTU) per day</p></li>
<li><p>Data was available at various levels of granularity across the US including plant-level, county-level, state-level, and aggregate estimates for the entire US. Data was aggregated or split out appropriately so that the resulting dataset contains values on the county-level, given by county FIPS code. When data collected was provided at the state-level, state-level totals are divided among state counties through an appropriate method (e.g. population weighting). When information was available at the plant level (e.g. power plant generation), information on plant county were used to sum plant values to achieve a county total. US level estimates were predominantly related to intensity factors or fractions. For example, the fraction of all corn grown for ethanol fuel is a US-level estimate and applied to county-level corn production.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All data used in the 2015 US Case Study including input flow values, energy or water intensity values, discharge fractions, and others are described in the various methodology sections. References to each can be found on the references page. A folder containing all input data is also provided with the package.</p>

<h3>US Counties<a class="headerlink" href="#us-counties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to get values at the county-level across multiple datasets in a consistent manner, a set of counties was established as the base county list for 2015. This list contains all US counties (not including US Territories) included in the USGS 2015 water use dataset (Dieter et al. [1]). Given that some datasets used in compiling the full sample dataset are from multiple years, some of the county-level FIPS codes required modification in order to match those provided in the 2015 base list. These modifications include mapping older FIPS codes to the 2015 ones or adding new FIPS codes when new counties were created. These modifications were mostly required for values used in from the 1995 USGS dataset Solley et al. [7]).</p>

<h3>GeoJSON<a class="headerlink" href="#geojson" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to plot county-level outputs from the US 2015 dataset, a GeoJSON file containing geometry information for the US counties is required. The file used and included in the sample data is from Plotly’s sample datafiles. The raw JSON datafile can be found in Plotly [19]. A small number of counties included in the GeoJSON file required adjustment to match the baseline county list for the sample data. The FIPS codes for these counties were adjusted accordingly in the GeoJSON file. Note that the modified version of this file is included in the input data, not the raw GeoJSON file.</p>

<h6><em>Public Water Deliveries</em><a class="headerlink" href="#public-water-deliveries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>Public water deliveries (public water demand) to the commercial sector are not directly provided in Dieter et al. [1] for 2015 for each county. The most recent year these values are provided is for 1995 from the USGS 1995 water use report (Solley et al. [7]). In order to estimate public water deliveries to the commercial sector, the ratio of deliveries to the commercial sector compared to deliveries to the commercial and thermoelectric cooling in aggregated in 1995 is applied to 2015 commercial and thermoelectric cooling delivery values. That is, if the 1995 ratio of commercial water deliveries from public water supply was half that of public water deliveries to the commercial sector and thermoelectric cooling in aggregate in an individual county, then the 2015 public water deliveries to the commercial sector would be equal to half the public water deliveries to the commercial sector and thermoelectric cooling in aggregate for 2015.</p>
<p>For 1995 counties that do not have public water deliveries to the commercial sector, the average ratio for the given state is applied instead. Note that this may overestimate public water deliveries to commercial sector in some counties. No counties that have at least some public deliveries to either the commercial sector or thermoelectric cooling will have 0 public water deliveries to the commercial sector.</p>

<p>Consumption of water by the commercial sector is not provided in Dieter et al. [1]. The most recent year with data available is the 1995 USGS water use report. Instead of directly using the consumptive use (mgd) from the commercial sector from the 1995 factor, a consumption fraction (%) was calculated based on the ratio of water consumed by the commercial sector and total water flows to the commercial sector in 1995. In order to fill consumption fraction values for counties that did not have consumed water values in 1995 but may have consumed water in 2015, the state average consumption fraction was substituted.</p>

<h6><em>Fuel Demand</em><a class="headerlink" href="#fuel-demand" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>Energy demand by the commercial sector is supplied on a state-basis from U.S. EIA for 2015. EIA provides information on energy supply (fuels) that go to sectors other than electricity generation in their SEDS dataset [8]. Each fuel is given in BTUs per year and is categorized by a specific MSN code. For the commercial sector, this includes the following MSN codes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>NGCCB - Natural gas consumed by (delivered to) the commercial sector</p></li>
<li><p>PACCB - All petroleum products consumed by the commercial sector</p></li>
<li><p>WWCCB - Wood and waste energy consumed in the commercial sector</p></li>
<li><p>CLCCB - Coal consumed by the commercial sector</p></li>
<li><p>GECCB - Geothermal energy consumed by the commercial sector</p></li>
<li><p>SOCCB - Solar energy consumed by the commercial sector</p></li>
<li><p>WYCCB - Wind energy consumed by the commercial sector</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Values are adjusted to BBTU per day.</p>
<p>To split up state total values to individual counties within a state, total values are split out based on county population. For example, if County 1 in State A makes up 10% of the total state population, then 10% of the state total natural gas deliveries to the commercial sector are in that county. County population data for 2015 is directly provided in Dieter et al. [1]</p>

<p>Energy flows into each electricity generator were based on the provided input fuel amount in the EIA dataset. These values were converted from bbtu per year to bbtu per day. Power plants with zero generation and zero fuel were removed from the dataset. For power plants that were missing fuel inputs but had generation outputs provided, an assumed efficiency rating of 30% was used to generate fuel input values. For example, if the generation output for a plant was 10 bbtu per day but no fuel input was provided, the fuel input was estimated to be (1/.3) * 10 bbtu.</p>
<p>Individual power plants were mapped to county FIPS codes based on the listed county within the EIA dataset.</p>

<p>Energy services from each generator type is generally equal to the ratio of total electricity generation over the total fuel input from each power plant.

<li><p><strong>Thermoelectric Cooling Water Withdrawals</strong> - Estimates for water withdrawn for thermoelectric cooling were provided by two sources, Harris et al. [14] and Macknick et al. [15]. The first dataset includes water withdrawals (mgd) and consumption (mgd) by EIA power plant code ID. Some water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge estimates were missing for many of the plants provided in [14] when mapped to the EIA 923 [13] power plant generation data by plant code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To fill in estimates for the remaining power plants, Macknick et al. [15] values were used. Given that the cooling type of each power plant is unknown, the average cooling water intensity for all cooling types for each generation technology (e.g., nuclear, natural gas) was used from [15]. No values were available for petroleum in [15]. For this generation type, the average of all other technologies was assumed. This same methodology was also applied to ‘other’ generation types. Though some renewable technologies such as Solar CSP require cooling, no withdrawal values were provided in [15]. Total water withdrawal per plant for missing estimates was calculated as the water withdrawal intensity (gallons/mwh of generation) multiplied by the estimated power plant generation in EIA 923 [13]. The same methodology was applied for consumption quantities using consumption intensity estimates from Macknick et al. [15].</p>
<p>Harris et al. [14] additionally provides information on the water source and water type for each withdrawal flow for each power plant. These values were used to map water withdrawal flows for each power plant to a specific water source node. For simplicity, water types were binned into categories as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘SW’: ‘surfacewater’  (river, canal, bay)</p></li>
<li><p>‘GW’: ‘groundwater’,  (well, aquifer)</p></li>
<li><p>‘PD’: ‘wastewater’,  (PD = plant discharge)</p></li>
<li><p>“-nr-”: “surfacewater”,  (all blanks assumed to be surface water)</p></li>
<li><p>“GW &amp; PD”: “groundwater”,  (all GW+PD are assumed to be groundwater only)</p></li>
<li><p>“GW &amp; SW”: ‘surfacewater’,  (all GW+SW combinations are assumed to be surface water)</p></li>
<li><p>“OT”: “surfacewater” (all “other” water source is assumed to be surface water)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, information on water type were binned in the following way:
* ‘FR’: ‘fresh’
* ‘SA’: ‘saline’
* ‘OT’: ‘fresh’  (all other source is assumed to be fresh water)
* “FR &amp; BE”: ‘fresh’  (all combinations with fresh and BE are assumed to be fresh)
* “BE”: “fresh”  (reclaimed wastewater set to fresh)
* “BR”: “saline” (all brackish is set to saline)
* “”: “fresh”  (all blanks are assumed to be fresh)</p>
<p>It is assumed that all water withdrawal estimates not provided in [14] and generated by water withdrawal intensity estimates in [15] come from fresh surface water and the cooling type has been set to ‘Complex’.</p>
<p>Note that some power plants have fuel inputs and generation amounts but had 0 water withdrawals in Harris et al. [14]. These values are not adjusted as they are assumed to be recirculating cooling type with negligible water withdrawals.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Hydropower Water Use</strong> - Water use in hydropower is not available in the 2015 USGS water dataset (Dieter et al. [1]), however, it is available in the 1995 USGS water use dataset (Solley et al. [7]). The 1995 dataset provides water use for instream hydropower by county and the annual energy (mwh) generated by hydropower plants in the same county. Water use in hydropower here is associated with all water that passes through the hydropower gates. It can be interpreted as an immediate withdrawal and discharge from surface water.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate hydropower water use intensity rates by county, the ratio was taken between total water withdrawals for instream hydropower per county to total daily power generation per county from the 1995 dataset. This is converted to million gallons per bbtu of energy generated. A number of counties had large outlier water withdrawal intensity values. For example, the county with the highest intensity had an intensity value 6x that of the next highest value. For this reason, the decision was made to cap hydropower withdrawal intensities at 6 million mgd/bbtu (approximately the 90th percentile). This changed values for 396 counties in the dataset.</p>
<p>To account for counties that may have gained hydropower between 1995 and 2015 and would have no intensity estimate from the 1995 dataset, the 1995 counties with zero hydropower generation had their withdrawal intensities set to the state average. For states with no hydropower, their counties were filled in with the US average.</p>
<p>These water intensities are used with hydro electricity generation from the EIA 923 [13] dataset for 2015.</p>

<p>The following energy production (fuel) types are included in the analysis:
- Natural gas
- Petroleum
- Coal
- Biomass</p>
<p>For all of the fuel production types except coal, data by type is taken from US EIA SEDS state-level data for 2015 [8]. Data is provided in BBTU/yr. Information is provided at the state level and broken up based on various methodologies described in greater detail below.</p>
<p>MSN codes used from the EIA SEDS [8] dataset include:
- “PAPRB”: Crude oil production (including lease condensate)
- “EMFDB”: Biomass inputs (feedstock) to the production of fuel ethanol
- “NGMPB”: Natural gas marketed production</p>
<p>Coal production data is provided in an alternative mine-level dataset [17] that allows us to aggregate production to the county level. This is discussed in greater detail later on this page.</p>
<p>Note that for energy sources that are not direct fuels (e.g., solar, nuclear), any production is directly consumed and values are captured in electricity production or fuel demand by end use sectors.</p>
<p>Various methods are used to break up state-level energy production values into county level values. These are described for each of the four fuel types below.</p>
<section id="coal-production">
<h5><strong>Coal Production</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#coal-production" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Coal production at the county level is provided from two separate datasets. The first dataset, US EIA E-7 [17], includes coal production data (tons), coal mine type (surface or underground), as well as the Mine ID number for 2015. The Mine ID number provided in the US EIA dataset is used to map coal mine data to the secondary dataset (coal mine data provided by the US Department of Labor - Mine Safety and Health Administration [18]). The latter of these datasets includes the county FIPS codes for each Mine ID that is used to aggregate production to the county level. While information is provided for Refuse coal mines in the EIA dataset in addition to surface and underground mines, these mines are not included in this analysis.</p>
<p>Coal production for each mine type is provided in short tons per year. This is converted to bbtu where one short ton is equal to 0.02009 bbtu. Production values by mine type are aggregated to the county level.</p>

<h5><strong>County-level Natural Gas Production</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#county-level-natural-gas-production" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To obtain county-level estimates of natural gas production from state-level estimates for 2015, a 2011 USDA Economic Research Service dataset [26] of county-level natural gas production is used. The data provides production values for onshore production in the lower 48 states. No data for years 2012 onwards was found and the data product has since been discontinued by USDA. The fraction of state production for each county within a given state was multiplied by state level natural gas production values provided from EIA SEDS [8] to get county-level estimates.</p>
<p>The state production dataset from EIA SEDS [8] includes state-level values for states that are not included in the county-level production data from USDA [26]. For these states, production by county are individually assessed from a variety of sources, described below.</p>
<p>For the state of Idaho, all production of natural gas is estimated to come from a single county (Payette County) according to a 2016 data release by the Idaho Department of Lands [27]</p>
<p>Data from the State of Alaska’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission [28] helps to pinpoint which regions of the state are the primary producers of natural gas. The large majority of natural gas production comes from the North Slope area of Alaska (&gt;96%) while the remainder is produced in the Cook Inlet Basin (Kenai Peninsula). These percentages are used to split up total state natural gas production for 2015.</p>
<p>For the state of Maryland, natural gas production was found to occur in two different counties (Garret County and Allegany County) according to a state energy analysis provided by EIA [29]. No information was found on the relative production within each county. As a result, it is assumed that production is split evenly between the two counties. No year is associated with these county estimates, however, it is assumed that the location of recoverable natural gas in the state will not change substantially. Both counties are in the western part of the state and overlie part of the Marcellus Shale. Note that, since 2017 Maryland enacted a permanent ban on hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil production.</p>
<p>Very low natural gas production exists for the state of Nevada. The production that did occur in 2015 is estimated to originate from Nye County. This estimate is predominantly formed upon the basis that the largest number of oil and gas well potential appears clustered within that county. Information for this estimate is provided through potential oil and gas well maps from the University of Nevada - Reno [30].</p>
<p>For the state of Oregon, only one county is listed for gas production (Columbia County) associated with the Mist Gas Field. Information for this estimate is provided by the State of Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries [31]. The data on production under this gas field is provided annually with values available for 2015. All state natural gas production for Oregon for 2015 is assigned to this county.</p>

<p>Limited information exists on a county-level for petroleum production that differentiates between conventional and unconventional production. According to the US EIA, 63% of all oil is shale (unconventional) [32]. Until additional information is available, it is assumed that state-level petroleum production is divided out into the two categories by this fraction.</p>

<p>Two states appear in the EIA SEDS [8] petroleum production datafile that do not appear in the 2011 USDA [26] county level production and must be filled in individually, these are described below.</p>
<p>For the state of Idaho, all production of unconventional petroleum is estimated to come from a single county (Payette County) according to a 2016 data release by the Idaho Department of Lands [27]</p>
<p>Data from the State of Alaska’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission [28] helps to pinpoint which regions of the state are the primary producers of unconventional petroleum.

<p>Following the assumption that 63% of all petroleum production is unconventional petroleum production, the remainder falls to conventional production. State-level petroleum production values are split into conventional and unconventional petroleum through this fraction.

<section id="water-withdrawal">
<h6><em>Water Withdrawal</em><a class="headerlink" href="#water-withdrawal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>To determine the amount of water used in the production of coal from each type of coal mine (surface vs. underground), the assumptions from Greenberg et al. [4] are used. Greenberg et al. [4] estimates that surface mines withdraw 7 gallons of water per ton of coal and underground mines withdraw 29 gallons per ton. To determine water source/type for mining dust control, it is assumed that the source of the water withdrawal for coal mining follows the same distribution of water use for other types of mining in the same county. For example, if 50% of water withdrawals for all mining in a county are estimated to come from fresh surface water, the same percentage is applied to coal mining. Water withdrawals for all mining types is provided in the USGS 2015 water use dataset [1].</p>
<p>Given that water withdrawals for coal mining are implicitly included in the water withdrawals for all mining in the USGS 2015 [1] dataset, the estimated water withdrawals for coal mining are subtracted from the water withdrawals to all mining to avoid double counting. This is completed by multiplying the county-level coal production for both surface and underground mines in bbtu by the estimated water intensity values described above. The outcome is substracted from the water withdrawals to mining provided in Dieter et al. [1] for the year 2015. For counties where the estimated water use for coal mining exceeded the amount of water in all mining presented in the USGS data file (Dieter et al. [1]), the amount of water to non-coal mining was set to zero.</p>
<p>Water use in coal mining is represented as water withdrawals delivered to the mining sector under the coal subsector category.</p>

<h6><em>Agricultural Irrigation of Corn for Ethanol</em><a class="headerlink" href="#agricultural-irrigation-of-corn-for-ethanol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>Water use in the production of ethanol is included in two forms in this analysis: (1) water use in the agriculture sector that is put towards the irrigation of corn used in the production of ethanol and (2) water used in the industrial sector to process the corn and produce ethanol. These flow values are provided separately and are described in greater detail below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Water Withdrawal</strong> - Data on water used in corn growth for ethanol production does not exist explicitly at any level of granularity and must be calculated out from larger state-level totals of irrigation water and corn production. The general methodology for calculating the water use in biomass follows that outlined in Greenberg et al. [4], however, a national average percent of corn grown for ethanol (described below) is used in place of their ethanol fraction estimate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The assumed percent of all corn grown for ethanol in the US was used from the US DOE Alternative Fuels Data Center [20]. Total corn production for ethanol (5.22 billion bushels) was divided by total corn production (13.6 billion bushels) for 2015 and calculated to be 38.406%. Data on a state or county level for this estimate does not exist in a public database, therefore, this percentage is applied to all states with corn production. A state-level fraction of corn used for ethanol production could be calculated from the amount of ethanol produced in a state and applying an assumption of corn required per unit of ethanol, however, this would lead to data anomalies such as states like California producing an ethanol fraction of nearly 900% of their total corn production. Given that we are unable to determine which states the imported corn for ethanol would be coming from, the decision was made to apply the US total fraction to all states.</p>
<p>Total water used in the production of corn for ethanol is therefore the assumed 38.406% multiplied by the product of the total amount of irrigated acres of corn and the calculated irrigation intensity for that state (total acres applied to all crops / total acres irrigated, all crops) provided from USDA Census of Agriculture Irrigation and Water Management Survey (Perdue et al [22]), Table 35 and Table 4, respectively. The irrigation intensity for corn is assumed to be equivalent to the irrigation intensity for all crops given that state-level corn irrigation intensity data is not available.</p>
<p>To split the total water applied to crop irrigation for corn growth for ethanol between fresh surface water and fresh groundwater, USDA FRIS Census of Agriculture [21] data on surface water (surface water + off farm water) as a percent of total water (including groundwater) in corn production is used from Table 37 of [21]. Off-farm sources are assumed to be surface water.</p>
<p>Note: the state of New York (NY) does not have data on ground vs. surface water sources for corn irrigation. It is assumed, therefore, for this state, that the ratio between surface water and groundwater in corn growth for ethanol matches the average ratio from all other states.</p>
<p>To split state-level water use values into county-level values, county-level corn production data is used from USDA NASS [22]. It is assumed that the county level corn production as a fraction of state level corn production is an adequate way to split up state-level water withdrawal quantities. The county-level corn production fractions are multiplied by the state level water withdrawal values to obtain county-level water withdrawal values.</p>
<p>Water withdrawals for corn growth for ethanol are represented as a sub-subsector in the Agriculture-crop irrigation sector in the dataset. To avoid double counting in the data, the estimated water used in corn growth for ethanol is substracted from the water use in all crop irrigation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Water Consumption/Evaporation</strong> - Water consumption fraction estimates for corn growth for ethanol used in biomass are expected to follow the same consumption fraction estimates for all crop irrigation. This information is provided directly in in Dieter et al. [1].</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Water Discharge</strong> - Water discharge estimates for corn growth for ethanol used in biomass are expected to follow the same discharge estimates for all crop irrigation. All water discharged from crop irrigation is expected to be to the surface.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Water withdrawals in the industrial sector for the production of ethanol is separated out as an individual subsector under the Industrial sector.

<p>No county level water use or water intensity estimates exist for natural gas for the year 2015. Water use estimates for natural gas extraction for this analysis are used from Greenberg et al. [4].  Only state-level values for unconventional petroleum and natural gas extraction are available in their dataset. State-level values are split into county-level values following the same methodology used to split up the state-level natural gas production values described previously.</p>
<p>The intensity of water use in unconventional natural gas drilling was determined by taking the total water to unconventional natural gas production in each county and dividing it by the total natural gas production per day in the same county. The average intensity value (million gallons per bbtu) was applied to counties that recorded unconventional natural gas production in 2015 but no water estimates were available.</p>
<p>It is assumed that 80% of water withdrawals by natural gas production are from fresh surface water sources and the remainder is from fresh groundwater sources following the methodology in Greenberg et al.

<p>When water is injected into the ground for natural gas production, some additional water is extracted or “produced”. No exact values exist regarding produced water for oil and natural gas individually. Veil [32] provided an analysis for 2017 on produced water by state and Greenberg et al.

Produced water values are converted to million gallons of water per bbtu and applied to unconventional natural gas production by county. For states without a value, the US average is supplied.</p>
<p>The water-oil-ratio (WOR) (barrels of water/barrel of oil) and water-gas-ratio (WGR) [barrels of water/million cubic feet (mmcf) of natural gas] from Greenberg et al. [4] were applied to 2015 data on oil and gas production to estimate total produced water. For the state of Idaho, which did not have a WOR value in the dataset, the WOR and WGR was assumed to be the average of both Montana and Wyoming. This produced water was split out into injection, surface discharge, and consumption/evaporation based on percentage breakdowns by state provided in [32].

Public water deliveries (public water demand) to the industrial sector are not directly provided in Dieter et al. [1] for 2015 for each county. The most recent year these values are provided is for 1995 from the USGS 1995 water use report (Solley et al. [7]). In order to estimate public water deliveries to the industrial sector, the ratio of deliveries to the industrial sector compared to deliveries to the residential and thermoelectric cooling in aggregated in 1995 is applied to 2015 residential and thermoelectric cooling delivery values. That is, if the 1995 ratio of industrial water deliveries from public water supply was half that of public water deliveries to the residential sector and thermoelectric cooling in aggregate in an individual county, then the 2015 public water deliveries to the industrial sector would be equal to half the public water deliveries to the residential sector and thermoelectric cooling in aggregate for 2015.</p>
<p>For 1995 counties that do not have public water deliveries to the industrial sector, the average ratio for the given state is applied instead. Note that this may overestimate public water deliveries to industrial sector in some counties. No counties that have at least some public deliveries to either the residential sector or thermoelectric cooling will have 0 public water deliveries to the industrial sector.

<p>Values are adjusted to BBTU per day.</p>
<p>To split up state total values to individual counties within a state, total values are split out based on county population. For example, if County 1 in State A makes up 10% of the total state population, then 10% of the state total natural gas deliveries to the industrial sector are in that county. County population data for 2015 is directly provided in Dieter et al. [1]</p>

<p>Electricity demand by the residential sector is also supplied by US EIA for 2015. Electricity delivery values are used from the Electric Power Annual dataset for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors [9]. Values are originally provided in annual MWh and are converted to BBTU per day. State level values are broken up into county-level approximations based on population following the same methodology as the fuel deliveries.</p>

<p>The industrial sector is assumed to have an efficiency of 49%, in line with estimates provided in Greenberg et al. [4]. Therefore, 49% of all energy used in the industrial sector is assumed to go to energy services.
<em>Rejected Energy</em>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given the assumed efficiency of 49%, 51% of energy in the industrial sector is assumed to go to rejected energy.</p>

<h4>Water in the Mining Sector<a class="headerlink" href="#water-in-the-mining-sector" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Water in the mining sector includes mining of energy and non-energy applications. Energy applications within mining include coal mining, natural gas drilling, and petroleum drilling. In order to separate these values out, water use in each of the listed energy-focused mining applications is calculated separately and subtracted out from the water values described below (provided by Dieter et al. [1] for 2015). To see the methodology for water in coal mining, water in natural gas drilling, and water in both conventional and unconventional petroleum drilling, see the Energy Production methodology section.
<strong>Water Demand</strong>
“””””””””””””””””””””””””””</p>
<p>Water withdrawal (self-supply) values are directly provided in Dieter et al. [1] at a county level and are used directly. This includes fresh and saline water from both surface and ground sources.</p>
<p>No public water delivery estimates to the mining sector are supplied by Dieter et al. [1] and no public water deliveries are estimated for the mining sector.</p>

<h6><em>Consumption/Evaporation</em><a class="headerlink" href="#id21" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>Consumption of water by the mining sector is not provided in Dieter et al. [1]. The most recent year with data available is the 1995 USGS water use report (Solley et al. [7]). Instead of directly using the consumptive use (mgd) from the mining sector from the 1995 factor, consumption fractions (%) for fresh water and saline water were individually calculated based on the ratio of water consumed by the mining sector and total water flows to the mining sector in 1995. Each fraction is then used with the appropriate fresh or saline 2015 water flows to the mining sector to determine 2015 fresh/saline water flows from the mining sector to consumption/evaporation.</p>
<p>In order to fill consumption fraction values for counties that did not have consumed water values in 1995 but may have consumed water in 2015, the state average consumption fraction was substituted.
Water Discharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discharge to Surface - It is assumed that all fresh water withdrawn by the mining sector that is not consumed is discharged to the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Discharge to Ocean - It is assumed that all saline water withdrawn by the mining sector that is not consumed is discharged to the ocean.</p></li>
<li><p>Discharge to Wastewater Supply - It is assumed that no discharges from the mining sector go to the wastewater supply.</p></li>
