# US Case Study

## Background
The motivation of the Integrated Water Power Resilience Project is to identify and develop opportunities to improve resilience in the water and power sectors through coordinated planning, investment, and operations and thereby provide benefits to power and water utilities, consumers, and the environment.

Water and power utilities are interdependent, subject to many of the same natural and manmade hazards, and critical for the well-being of communities and society. Because of the interconnectedness of water and power systems there are substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits to co-managing the market sectors for resilience, instead of managing them separately.

To support this initiative and future research in this area, the **flow** model was developed to build, calculate, and visualize interconnections in water and energy between various sectors.


## General Methodology
The following list of assumptions are applicable to the 2015 US Case Study:
- Calculations are for the year 2015, the most recent year available for comprehensive county-level water use data in the US. When data was unavailable for 2015, the closest year available was applied or methods were developed to develop data for 2015 based on factors from previous years.
- Many calculation methodologies and intensity parameters are informed by the literature. References for these methodologies are noted in the methodology descriptions as applicable.
- Water values are provided in million gallons per day (MGD) and energy values are provided in billion British thermal units (BBTU) per day
- Data was available at various levels of granularity across the US including plant-level, county-level, state-level, and aggregate estimates for the entire US. Data was aggregated or split out appropriately so that the resulting dataset contains values on the county-level, given by county FIPS code. When data collected was provided at the state-level, state-level totals are divided among state counties through an appropriate method (e.g. population weighting). When information was available at the plant level (e.g. power plant generation), information on plant county were used to sum plant values to achieve a county total. US level estimates were predominantly related to intensity factors or fractions. For example, the fraction of all corn grown for ethanol fuel is a US-level estimate and applied to county-level corn production.


## Data
All data used in the 2015 US Case Study including input flow values, energy or water intensity values, discharge fractions, and others are described in the various methodology sections. References to each can be found on the references page. A folder containing all input data is also provided with the package.
