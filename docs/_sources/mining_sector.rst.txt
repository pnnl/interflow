Water in the Mining Sector
################################################
Water in the mining sector includes mining of energy and non-energy applications. Energy applications within mining include coal mining, natural gas drilling, and petroleum drilling. In order to separate these values out, water use in each of the listed energy-focused mining applications is calculated separately and subtracted out from the water values described below (provided by Dieter et al. [1] for 2015). To see the methodology for water in coal mining, water in natural gas drilling, and water in both conventional and unconventional petroleum drilling, see the Energy Production methodology section.

**Water Demand**
**********************************

*Water Withdrawals*
-----------------------------
Water withdrawal (self-supply) values are directly provided in Dieter et al. [1] at a county level and are used directly. This includes fresh and saline water from both surface and ground sources.

*Public Water Deliveries*
-----------------------------
No public water delivery estimates to the mining sector are supplied by Dieter et al. [1] and no public water deliveries are estimated for the mining sector.

**Water Discharge/Evaporation**
**********************************

*Consumption/Evaporation*
-----------------------------
Consumption of water by the mining sector is not provided in Dieter et al. [1]. The most recent year with data available is the 1995 USGS water use report (Solley et al. [7]). Instead of directly using the consumptive use (mgd) from the mining sector from the 1995 factor, consumption fractions (%) for fresh water and saline water were individually calculated based on the ratio of water consumed by the mining sector and total water flows to the mining sector in 1995. Each fraction is then used with the appropriate fresh or saline 2015 water flows to the mining sector to determine 2015 fresh/saline water flows from the mining sector to consumption/evaporation.

In order to fill consumption fraction values for counties that did not have consumed water values in 1995 but may have consumed water in 2015, the state average consumption fraction was substituted.

Water Discharge
-----------------------------

* Discharge to Surface - It is assumed that all fresh water withdrawn by the mining sector that is not consumed is discharged to the surface.
* Discharge to Ocean - It is assumed that all saline water withdrawn by the mining sector that is not consumed is discharged to the ocean.
* Discharge to Wastewater Supply - It is assumed that no discharges from the mining sector go to the wastewater supply.
