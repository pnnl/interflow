About
########

The interflow package (interflow) gives us the capability to organize and evaluate the interdependencies and linkages between sectors at various levels of granularity and across regions. We can use **interflow** to gain an understanding of topics such as:

1. Which sectors have a high reliance on upstream sectors?
2. Which sectors represent pivotal nodes for passing on resource flows to downstream flows?
3. How do resource intensities in sectors compare across regions?
4. What does the network of resource flows in a region look like?
5. Where are the opportunities for network enhancement, optimization, resource security, and resiliency improvement?

In addition to calculating and organizing flows across sectors, **interflow** also provides visualization options to pull meaning from the aggregated data output. For more information on the output of the interflow package, see the `Key Outputs <https://pnnl.github.io/interflow/user_guide.html#key-outputs>`_ section
